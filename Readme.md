# New York Times

> This is a Microverse project for students. It involves the use of several positioning techniques like float, position absolute, position relative, grid, flex. For the
  navigation bar I used a flex container, for the image of the "Theory of inflation" article I used position relative and absolute, for the grilled sugested posts at the 
  bottom I used a grid container, for the navigation menu at the bottom of the page I used float.
